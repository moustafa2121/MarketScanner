## Market Scanner

### About
An SPA that compiles vape products from several websites into one table that can be navigated, searched, and filtered. The main motivation was to get all available products from several websites in one clean table, as some vape websites are usually messy and have clunky filter/search functionalities.

Users can click on any product and it will redirect them to the itemâ€™s page on its corresponding website. 


### Built with
- Flask
- Bootstrap
- SQLAlchemy

### Features
-	Responsive display
-	Pagination
-	Data filtering
  o	Filter based on website, name, product attributes, and other categories
  o	Combine filters (concurrently or consecutively)
  o	Filter options are based on the data fetched (i.e. filtered data will have a filter that contains exclusively their attributes for further filtering)

Crawling of the items from the original source website may not always yield perfect results due to the poor HTML structure of some sites. As a result, some data on this website may appear as "No Data" in the table. Some items may be out of stock.
